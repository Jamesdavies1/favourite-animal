        <p>Foxes are members of the dog family. 
            A female fox is called a vixen, a male fox is called a dog fox 
            or a tod and baby foxes are called pups, kits or cubs.
             A group of foxes is called a skulk or a leash. <br>
             Foxes are the only type of dog capable of retracting their 
             claws like cats do. Foxes also have vertical pupils that look more like 
             those of cats than the rounded pupils that other dogs have.</p>
